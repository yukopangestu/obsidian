- [New manager training: The 4 concepts to teach](https://canopy.is/blog/2020/06/21/new-manager-training-the-4-concepts-to-teach/)
	- **When you’re an individual contributor, your success is defined by the work that _you_ do. When you’re a manager, your success is defined by how well you enable _other_ people to get the work done.**
	- Sort of. **To build trust _effectively_, we must go deeper.** Researchers have identified two different types of trust: “Affective trust,” which comes from our sense of rapport or emotional closeness with a person, and “Cognitive trust,” which is based on our belief in the other person’s competence and reliability. To truly build trust as a manager, we need to do both. In short: Your new managers need to not only foster rapport with their team, and also follow through on what they say they’re going to do in order to build trust.

- T shaped skill
	- **Resource**
		- [T-shaped Employees and how to grow it as an Agile Leader - one of the Patterns for successful Agile change](https://dandypeople.com/blog/t-shaped-employees-and-how-to-grow-it-as-an-agile-leader/)
	    - [Why Your Organization Needs T-Shaped People](https://bettermarketing.pub/why-your-organization-needs-t-shaped-people-4ddce4c82a1d)
	- **Characteristics of a T-shaped employee:**
		1. **Depth of Expertise (Vertical Bar):**
		    - Specializes in a specific domain or discipline.
		    - Has a high level of expertise, experience, and technical skills in this area.
		    - Capable of solving complex problems within their field of specialization.
		2. **Breadth of Knowledge (Horizontal Bar):**
		    - Possesses a working knowledge of other disciplines and fields.
		    - Understands how their specialization interacts with other areas.
		    - Able to communicate and collaborate effectively with professionals from different backgrounds.
		    - Adaptable and open to learning new skills and concepts.
	- **To understand how Connectors work, consider this analogy from the world of sports: A professional tennis player’s coach may be the most important voice guiding the player’s development, but she may bring in other experts—for strength training, nutrition, and specialized skills such as serves, lobs, and backhands—instead of trying to teach everything herself. Despite this outsourcing, the coach remains deeply involved, identifying expertise, facilitating introductions, and monitoring progress.**
	- **“Being a Connector is more about asking the right questions, providing tailored feedback, and helping employees make a connection to a colleague who can help them.” The most difficult part is often self-knowledge and candor: Being a Connector requires a manager to recognize that he’s not qualified to teach a certain skill and to admit that deficiency to a subordinate. “That isn’t something that comes naturally,” Roca says.**
- Influence
	- Resource: [LeadingbyInfluence.pdf](https://training.hr.ufl.edu/resources/LeadershipToolkit/job_aids/LeadingbyInfluence.pdf)
	- More likely what i have done so far is by establish credibility by "walk the talk"
	- Involving team member when wanted to implement something
	- To be able to influence, you need to be open to influence yourself (the best dah)
	- Main takeaway: leading by example
- Culture

- [Adding Value as an Engineering Manager](https://lethain.com/adding-value-as-an-engineering-manager/)
	- **The most common failure mode for new engineering managers is spending too much of their time on technical work. There are some tricks you can use to help with this–try scheduling one day a week only working on management work–but I think the real issue here is that many managers don’t believe that managers can really contribute much of value to their team.**
	- An engineering manager’s most valuable contributions are:
		1. working on the system (rather than in the system),
		2. nurturing the team,
		3. guiding execution,
		4. managing communication.
	- Able to let go if the situation is toxic within the team

- [Being an Engineering Manager](https://medium.com/@marcus.cavalcanti/being-a-engineering-manager-9d2854867412) (Need to re-read)
	- Delegate more and more. This can be one of your thermometers: find a method to keep the things you delegated under minimum control. Don’t punish yourself too much, some plates will break.
	- As a result of your seniority, you are expected to be more involved in strategic decisions, such as: establishing teams structure, sharing learnings with engineer community, improving the hiring process together with HR team, making decisions on the future of a product or system architecture, having discussions with vendors to negotiate best conditions, driving communication across senior leadership, etc.
